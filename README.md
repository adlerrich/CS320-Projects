How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
With so many approaches to solving a problem, I like to consider the options available to me first. Afterwards, I begin implementing it one step at a time, often forming a skeleton with TODO functions so that I can get a cleara idea of the program as a whole instead of getting tunnel visioned on the individual functions I'm working through. Next is writing it, paying close attention to the errors presented by my IDE and making sure that things are structurally sound, regulary running and testing the completed parts of the code to ensure it's working as expected.
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I can continually reference the design doc to ensure that my software aligns to the requirements set forth. I also like to consider what I need, and what I would like as a user to ensure I'm adding necessary functionality to my software.
How do I approach designing software?
I take one step at a time, and make sure that everything works correctly before moving on to the next step. Taking this approach allows me to catch most if not all problems throughout the course of development and produce clean, working code.
